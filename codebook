For this project, the following steps were performed to generate a tidy dataset for the purpose of data aggregation of means by subject identifier and related action.

1.  X_train, X_test datasets are loaded
2.  features dataset loaded for possible column name application
    a.  Column names require update prior to be assigned to the raw data files
    b.  Identified columns with pattern "()-##-## are renamed to dummycol## to avoid processing error on uniqueness
    c.  Columns assigned to X_train and X_test
3.  Activity labels (y_train, y_test) are then appended using cbind to the respective raw dataset
4.  The subject identifier (subject_train, subject_test) are then appended using cbind to the respective raw dataset
5.  Human readable activity labels are merged in using an inner_join to the numeric activity id previously added
6.  The two working datasets are then appended together using rbind giving a working combined data frame
7.  Raw datasets are restricted to only those that are needed for final analysis
    a.  Pattern matching looking for mean()
    b.  Pattern matching looking for std()
8.  A grouping is created using the subjid and activity
9.  A summarize action is performed using the function means on all mean and std columns.

The final tidy dataset has the following 

  variable            | Description of use
  ----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------
  subjid                      | The unique subject identifier 
  activity                    | The type of activity performed during data collection
  filetype                    | The file type from which the original raw data was obtained
  Raw Measurements(rpting)    | All raw measurements with mean() or std() 
  
Raw data files have been modified to remove trailing extraneous characters whilst still retaining the basic naming convention from the original source in order to ensure preservation of intended columns and traceability.
